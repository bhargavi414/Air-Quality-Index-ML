This repository contains the air quality index data set which has columns with the concentration of several pollutant gases and environmental sensores i.e Temperature, Humidity,
and Wind direction and PM2.5(particulate matter) data which indicates the air quality.The Python file in the repository contains code to train the dataset using both Random Forest 
Regression and Linear Regression models from the scikit-learn library. Appropriate features and the target column are selected, and a graph comparing actual versus predicted values 
is plotted.
